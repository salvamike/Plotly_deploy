# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Plotly_deploy

In this project we built a web app with dashboards that has 158 anonymous people's belly button samples. The team of researchers and those who participated in the study will be able to visit a webpage and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species from their belly button live in their navels. Our database has demographic info of all participants. By selecting ID number, we will be able to see following dashboards:

- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
- Belly Button Washing Frequency per Week
- Bacteria Cultures per Sample
